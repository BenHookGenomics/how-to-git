# how-to-git

A repo with some branches and some pull requests designed to show how to:

* Use the Fetch & Rebase method of working (rather than pull)
* Write good commit messages
* Make good commits
    * Not too much sausage
    * Not squashing things into one big commit
* Make good Pull Requests
* Review Pull Requests like a boss
